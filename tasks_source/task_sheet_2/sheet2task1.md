# Tasksheet 2 - Task 1
In this task we must set up a root finding problem for the equation:
```
x * cosh(x) + x^3 = pi
```
If we wish to create a function that we can find the root of in order to solve for "x" in the above equation, a good choice would be to choose the associated function:
```
f(x) = x * cosh(x) + x^3 - pi = 0
```
This function would be a good way to set up the root finding problem, because finding what "x" that lets "f(x)" evaluate to 0 would be the same x that you plug in the very top equation to get an equality.
