# Tasksheet 8 - Task 10

[Here](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Numerical_Analysis/Power_iteration_examples) is the article
that I am referencing.

I learned that power iteration can also still be used for matrices whose dominant eigenvalues are complex.
If a matrix has real entries, then if complex eigenvalues exist, they will always come in conjugate pairs.
In order to iterate to the solution of dominant eigenvalue, the initial vector guess needs to include values that are complex.
Otherwise, the approximations to the dominant eigenvalue will bounce around meaninglessly.
