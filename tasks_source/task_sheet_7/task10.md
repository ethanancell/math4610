# Tasksheet 7 - Task 10

I found a journal article where the author uses conjugate gradient methods to find solutions in application to molecular electronic structure calculations. The systems of equations that related to the molecular electronic structure were large, so things like Gaussian elimination are quite slow, and Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration would not converge fast enough for the problem at hand. In this case where the matrix is storing large amounts of correlated energies and molecular properties, the conjugate gradient method reigned supreme. While reading this journal article, I learned about the application of these computational mathematics techniques to scientific problems.
