# Tasksheet 3 - Task 10

I found a small pdf that includes root finding to an application of an
engineering application. On page 83 (4 of the pdf), the author details
an equation that models the splitting of water vapor into oxygen and hydrogen.
In order to find out what mole fraction of water vapor creates the desired
equilibrium constant, Newton's method is applied to the function modeling
the splitting of water vapor and finds where the mole fraction equation has a
root.
