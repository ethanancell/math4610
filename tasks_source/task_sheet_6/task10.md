# Tasksheet 6 - Task 10

I found an application of Gauss-Seidel solving in sound transmission problems. Differential equations modeling coupled systems for sound transmission are particularly useful to solve with Gauss-Seidel, because it handles weakly coupled systems with just a few iterations and will also natively handle strongly coupled systems. The author also provides a physical interpretation of the convergence condition (maximum eigenvalue of iteration matrix less than one), so it is interesting to see an analytic condition show up in physical reality as well.
