# Tasksheet 4 - Task 10

In the resource I discovered, I found there are different levels and types of optimizations that you can pass to the compiler, and the compiler will enable or disable certain types of optimizations per the flag's instructions. Omitting a compiler flag is equivalent to the -O0 flag, which will use the most simple converting of instructions to machine code. The other most commonly used flag is the -O2 flag, which uses all of the optimizations available without increasing the size of the executable. The -O3 flag will do optimizations but will result in larger executables.
