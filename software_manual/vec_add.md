# Vector Addition
**Function Name**: ```double* vec_add(double u[], double v[], size_t length)```

**Header File**: vec_operations.h

**Author**: Ethan Ancell

**Language**: C. This code can be compiled with the GNU C compiler (gcc).

**Description/Purpose**: This function will add two vectors together and return the result.

**Input**:
* double u[] - the first vector
* double v[] - the second vector

**Output**: Returns a pointer to the vector that is created from the addition of the two. Make sure to free the memory in the pointer at the end of your program.
