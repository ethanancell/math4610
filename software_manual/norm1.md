# Vector 1-Norm
**Function Name**: ```vec_norm_1(double u[], size_t length)```

**Header File**: vec_norm.h

**Author**: Ethan Ancell

**Language**: C. This code can be compiled with the GNU C compiler (gcc).

**Description/Purpose**: This function computes the 1-norm for a vector, which is the sum of the absolute value of each of the individual components of the vector.

**Input**:
* double u[] - a pointer to the vector that we are taking the 1-norm of.
* size_t length - An integer length for the length of the vector.

**Output**: Returns a double with the 1-norm of the vector.

**Usage Example**: Example code using the 1-norm can be found [here.](https://github.com/ethanancell/math4610/blob/master/software/vectors/norm1.c)

The output from the console is the following:
