## A Write-up on Absolute and Relative Errors
The main consensus that I gathered from whether you should be using the absolute or relative error is that it entirely depends upon the context of your problem. The absolute error is useful for being precise in your distance from what you want to reach, but it has drawbacks in that we can't tell if the error is significant, because that depends on how large the correct value is. A relative error is generally more useful because you can get within a "percentage" of the true value, which is a lot more generalizable to any size of number you wish to approximate.

My sources for these sentences comes from the site https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/NumericalAnalysis/01Error/Error/
